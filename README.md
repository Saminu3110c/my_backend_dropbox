# Welcome to My Backend Dropbox
***

## Task
This project aimed to create a fully functional file synchronization app that mimics the core features of Dropbox. The key challenge was integrating user authentication, file uploads, folder management, file previews, and shared linksâ€”all in a secure and scalable cloud-based solution.

## Description
The "My Backend Dropbox" project is a cloud-based file management system where users can upload, organize, and share files through an intuitive interface. Users can:
- **Upload Files**: Securely upload files with metadata.
- **Folder Navigation**: Create and navigate through folders.
- **File Preview**: Preview image files and placeholders for non-image types.
- **File Sharing**: Generate secure links for sharing files.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented with Firebase to ensure user-specific access and file handling.
- **Firebase Integration**: Switched from AWS Amplify to Firebase for file storage, authentication, and backend processing.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saminu3110c/my_backend_dropbox.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd my_backend_dropbox
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash

## Usage

```
To use the app:
- **Login/Signup** with your credentials.
- **Upload files** by clicking the "Upload" button.
- **Navigate folders** by creating and browsing through directories.
- **Preview files** by clicking on any uploaded image.
- **Share files** by copying a secure link.
